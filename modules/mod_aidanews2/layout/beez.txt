---> What's this file for?

With AiDaNews2 you can associate to a CSS file a TXT file that describes the contents of the layout positions. 
The files need to have the same name, but they have to be placed in two different folders:
modules/mod_aidanews2/css
for the .css file, and
modules/mod_aidanews2/layout
for this txt file.
The module already contains some predefined css and txt files that you can use to try different styles in a quick and easy way.

---> How can I use these files in AiDaNews2?

That's simple: check out the "STYLE ~ CSS Values & pre-made stylings" tab of your AiDaNews2 module and make sure the "Get Style from" field
is set to "Style Sheet" or "Both".
Then open the "LAYOUT ~ Main Setup" tab and turn the "Use Style" field to Yes. That's it!

---> I want to combine two differently called files in one layout

To make things simpler for newbies I decided not to add this possibility in the module's backend. There's a couple of things you can do, anyway:
1) manually copy the layout you want to use in the "LAYOUT ~ Main Setup" tab. This will let you edit the layout freely if you need to do so.
2) swap the names of the files. If you want to use the "default" layout with the "purity" css, just give another name to "purity.txt"
(renaming instead of erasing is advised) and rename "default.txt" to "purity.txt". This is only advised if you want a quick look of how
the new layout would work out. If you're looking for a permanent change, read option 3 (updating will reset the changes made this way!)
3) copy the content of the css file you like in a new .css file, give it a name you like and put it in the modules/mod_aidanews2/css folder.
Do the same for the .txt file, but remember to give the two files the same name!
This option is useful if you want more istances of the module to share the same css and layout, as changes to the two files will be automatically
displayed in the whole bunch of modules! Easy, isn't it?

---> How does this file work?

The first 10 lines of this txt file contain a "title" and the contents of the 9 layout positions. When triggered to do so (see above) AiDaNews2 will
automatically scan this file for info and use those 9 lines instead of the parameters you insert in the fields.

---> How can I create my own layout?

It's easy: just create two files with the same name, but with 2 different extensions (.txt and .css). Then fill the CSS one with the rules
you need and the txt one with a title in the first line and the 9 modules positions right after, one on each line.
More info about this can be read in the questions above!

If your common notepad doesn't show you this file as divided into lines, don't save this file and use another program to read it
I recommend downloading Notepad++ (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), as it's really useful for programming too!
